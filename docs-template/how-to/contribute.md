# How to contribute

<!-- TODO: Update the links to point to the correct repo!! -->

Our documentation is hosted on the [Charmhub forum](link to charmhub overview page) to enable collaboration.
Please use the "Help us improve this documentation" links on each documentation page to either
directly change something you see that's wrong, ask a question, or make a suggestion about a potential
change via the comments section.

Our documentation is also available alongside the [source code on GitHub](link to github repo).
You may open a pull request with your documentation changes, or you can
[file a bug](link to github issues) to provide constructive feedback or suggestions.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](link to contributing.md file)
