# Charm architecture

At its core, the `ubuntu-motd-server` charm is deploying a [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) application that serves a Message Of The Day (MOTD) for Ubuntu clients.

It has been generated with the help of the [paas-charm](https://github.com/canonical/paas-charm/) project for Flask applications.

See the [charm-architecture](https://canonical-12-factor-app-support.readthedocs-hosted.com/latest/explanation/charm-architecture/) section of the `paas-charm` project to learn more about the charm architecture.
